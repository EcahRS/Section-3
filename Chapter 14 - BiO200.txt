Chapter 14 BIO200

Domains
	-Prokaryotes
		-Bacteria
		-Archaea
			-Shares a more recent common ancestor with Eukarya than with bacteria
Time Scale
	-Precambrian - 4.6bya to 541mya (most of earth's history)
		-First life - 3.8bya
		-Evolution of photosynthesis - 2.45bya
		-Eukaryotes - 2bya
		
	-Paleozoic - 541mya to 250mya
		-Cambrian explosion - 541mya (rapid evoluton of complex organisms)
		-Land became colonized, first by plants and fungi, then animals
		
	-Mesozoic - 250mya to 65mya (age of dinosaurs)
		-Dinosaurs dominate land
		-Mammals evolve
		-Flowering plants evolve
		-Dionsaur extinction event at end of period
		
	-Cenozoic - 65mya to now (after dinosaur extinction, mammals evolved into empty niches)
		-Mammals dominate land
		
Mass Exctinctions
	-Large numbers of species/families go extinct
	-5 major mass extinctions
	-Cretaceous extinction (some 66mya)
	
Cambrian explosion
	-Rapid evolution of many animal groups
	-Lasted about 30+ million years
	-Complex animal bodies evolved, became successful and there was rapid divergence
Classifications
	-Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species
	-Homo sapiens
	-Uppercase lowercase
	-if typed: italics
	-written: underlined
	
Kingdoms
	-Within Eukarya
		-Protists - anything that's not a plant, animal, fungi (to make it simple)
		-Plants
		-Fungi
		-Animals
	
Phylogeny
	-Evolutionary tree
	-Shows relationships and common ancestors
Clade
	-A branch of a phylogeny with an ancestor and all of the its descendants
	-Are nested within clades
